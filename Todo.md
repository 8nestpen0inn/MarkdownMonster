### Bugs and Needed Features
* Add Startup Check for WebView2
* Add WebView2 Environment/Process Cleanup Command Line


### WebView2 Async Updates 

* [ ] Fix Addin Interfaces to use `async`
* [ ] Switch Table Editor to WebView2
* [x] Fix Paste Code Dialog
* [x] Review Any Calls to `.RunSync` `.Result` `.GetResult` `.Wait`
* [ ] BrowserMessageBox -> WebView2 (should still work though)

#### Enhancements
* [ ] Update detect changes on file saving and show Comparison editor (#734)
* [ ] Edit Code In Editor on Context Menu (like Edit Image/Edit HREF)
* [ ] New Software Registration API


* [ ] Configuration settings overrides in YAML header

### Nice to Have
* [ ] Search for Blog Posts in Weblog Posts folder (walk tree and show titles)
* [ ] Add JavaScript {{Handlebars}} Processing to Snippets Addin


### Consideration
* [ ] Markup (Publishing) support
* [ ] reveal.js presentations
* [ ] Research **R Markdown**, **AsciiDoc**
        

### Table Editor
* [ ] Alignment in tables would be nice
* [ ] Would be nice to be able to re-sort tables somehow based on a certain column
* [ ] It takes quite a while to open the editor for a larger table
* [ ] And then trying to add another column to that table is even slower
